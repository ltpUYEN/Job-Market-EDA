* Analysis suggests a relationship between company size and the average years of experience required.

## Project Disclaimer

This dashboard was created as a study project some time ago using job market data, primarily for the purpose of learning Power BI and practicing analytical techniques in job market analysis. While it demonstrates analytical concepts, reviewing it now highlights areas for improvement in styling, chart design, and layout, showcasing the evolution of my skills since its creation.
